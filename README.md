<h1>Hello there.</h1>
I make "stuff" on "The Internet" and also walk with my leg.<br>
I am a PHP """Programmer""" and i am mostly known for <a href="https://coveryourselfinoil.com">CYIO</a><br>
I know *some* javascript, lots of PHP, CSS, HTML and SQL.<br><br>
Check out some of my projects:<br> |

I've made way more stuff but all of it doesn't really exist anymore, because i announce it and let it exist for around a day, then shut it down.<br>
I announce these on my <a href="https://discord.gg/trollface">Discord server</a>.<br>
I plan on putting some creations of mine on here, although not many.
<br><br>
I'm sorry, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sJUDx7iEJw">GNU</a>.
